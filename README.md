## Setup/Run
To run this chess program, simply navigate to the directory with the source files and type 'make' in the command line. 

Note: You must have gcc installed in order for the Makefile to work. Otherwise simply compile all (five) of the source files and run the program from your command line.

## Gameplay
Follow the instructions on screen. To select a piece, enter its letter-number coordinate pair (eg E5, F2). Then to move a piece, simply enter the coordinate pair for which you wish to move. type q at the "select piece" prompt to quit the game.

## Implementation Details
This implementation of chess has full support of chess rules, including En Passant and Castling. It also detects stalemates and, of course, checkmates.
